# CSF-Registration
The application enables automatic student transcript aggregation (via a webscraper for ParentPortal). The applicant's transcripts are then ran against a set of requirements to check if they qualify for CSF (point system, with different classes falling into different tiers, etc.) If the student qualifies they are added to a database. After membership payment (which can be accomplished by scanning the student's ID) they are considered a full member of the club.

This application was developed for Mission Vista High School CSF chapter #1399 in 2018. At the time it reduced the number of work hours that went into the registration process from approximately 60 hours (which was a very tedious process with manual transcript validation and point aggregation) to just 2 hours (completely automated outside of collecting student payment). The digitization of student records made for any easy transition to the CSF-Attendance application and prevented student document loss.
